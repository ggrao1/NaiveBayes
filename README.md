## Formula 

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;P(A/B)=\frac{P(B/A)P(A)}{P(B)}" title="\Large P(A/B)=\frac{P(B/A)P(A)}{P(B)}" />

- P(A/B) : Posterior Probability
- P(B/A) : Likelihood
- P(A) : Prior Probability
- P(B) : Evidence

## Dataset
Data collected via a online survey includes classTime, subjectType,	hungry,	weather, interest columns where interest in classs is been predicted.
Another dataset is "PlayTennis"
